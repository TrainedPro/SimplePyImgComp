# SimplePyImgComp

## Description:
This program is a very simple Python image compressor, can reduce the file size upto 10% its original size without any major visual loss. It is practically lossless, even when inspected with alot of precision

## Usage:
Run the file and a folder selection dialog will show up. Select the folder the images are in and run them. The quality has been tested extensively to make sure that it produces minimal loss of image quality while reducing the file size by alot but if you want more quality or a smaller file size, just adjust the quality parameter that is initialized in the start.
